Datastore (ndb)
===============

Ferris provides several supplemental utilities on top of the `NDB Datastore API <https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/ndb/>`_. These utilities are intended to complement the items in the ``google.appengine.ext.ndb`` package. Items that share the same name are intended to be drop-in replacements.
