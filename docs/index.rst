Welcome to Ferris 3
===================

Welcome! There are multiple sections of documentation. For some background on Ferris check out :doc:`introduction`. Most people begin with :doc:`getting_started` and then move on to the :doc:`tutorial`. Once you're comfortable with those take a deep dive into the :doc:`users_guide` and check out some :doc:`common_patterns`.
